The power of tools and design to shape being and identity is eloquently attested by the buzz caused by the world’s fairs, from the mid-nineteenth century till today, which became showcases for designs embodying the tech- nological and cultural accomplishments of the age. The famous Crystal Palace Exhibition in London in 1851 (Stocking 1987; Bü rdek 2005) paraded for the first time in a specially designed space the technologies, trinkets, and proto- types of the day—power looms, pumps, steam engines, industrial machines. As visitors made their way through the glass cathedral, it became clear to them that not all peoples in the world had achieved the same level of “development,” for there was no way the arts from “the stationary East” nor the handicrafts from “the aborigines” could ever match the “progress” of the West. Machines, after all, were “the measure of men” (Adas 1989). World’s fairs were not only shrines for the collective adoration of the “civilization” and progress brought about by the Enlightenment era but also machines for effecting what in cur- rent Latin American critical theory is called coloniality, that is, the hierarchical classifications of peoples in terms of race and culture.
These are but a few of the hundreds of objects one is likely to find in lavishly illustrated design history books. They are the stuff of design. And yet design is much more, perhaps even more so today than in the heyday of modernism. Let us now discuss what else there is in the world of design and how it contributes to shaping the design of the world and of our lives.
